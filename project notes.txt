I. Importing Libraries
If it gives _imaging or dll error about pillow;
ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _imaging: The specified module could not be found.
ImportError: cannot import name 'deferred_error' from 'PIL._util' (C:\Users\Harun\anaconda3\envs\myenv\lib\site-packages\PIL\_util.py):
conda uninstall pillow
conda activate <your_environment_name>
If the process has been stuck for a long time, you can try interrupting it by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal. After that, try running the uninstall command again:
conda uninstall pillow
if dont work; then
pip uninstall pillow

then you can install lower version:
conda install -c conda-forge pillow=9.0.0
If the Conda environment is taking a long time to solve the package environment, it could be due to various factors, including complex dependencies or conflicts. To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
conda clean --all
conda clean --index-cache
conda install pillow=9.0.0
conda install -c conda-forge --no-pin pillow=9.0.0
or 
conda install pillow=9.0.0
conda install -v pillow=9.0.0
